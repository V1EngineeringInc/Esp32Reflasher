## Reflasher

This project is just something that might help of you have a bunch of Skr boards and screens and you
need to flash them all over a micro sd card.

This doesn't do any flashing. It just renames files that end with a '.cur' file extension.

## Instructions

Give the board 5V on the 5V and ground pins.

It should not light up.

Put in a microSD card that had it's files changed to .cur (from SKR Pro or the bigtreetech screens).

The LED should be brighter for a moment, then flash briefly at 1/second.

Take the card out.
 - If you want to check the contents, go ahead, and look at the reflasherLog.txt for a log of what
   happened.

Put the card in the skr or screen and power it up.
